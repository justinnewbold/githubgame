# Quantum Garden 🌌🌱

A unique reality-bending video game where you tend a garden that exists in multiple quantum states simultaneously.

## Overview

Quantum Garden is unlike any game ever built. It combines quantum mechanics concepts with gardening simulation to create a meditative, philosophical experience where:

- **Your garden exists in superposition** - Multiple realities exist at once, each with different plants and growth patterns
- **Observer effect is real** - When you observe a quantum state, it collapses all other possibilities
- **Reality can split** - Create new parallel universes from a single state
- **Time flows continuously** - Your garden evolves even when you're not playing
- **Each playthrough is unique** - Quantum randomness ensures no two gardens are ever the same

## Installation

Requirements:
- Python 3.6 or higher
- No external dependencies needed!

## How to Play

1. Run the game:
```bash
python3 quantum_garden.py
```

2. On first run, a new quantum garden will be created with a seed in superposition across 3 quantum states.

3. Use the menu to interact with your garden:
   - **View Quantum States**: See all parallel realities of your garden
   - **Plant Seed**: Add new seeds that exist differently in each quantum state
   - **Collapse State**: Choose which reality to keep (destroys others)
   - **Create Superposition**: Split one reality into multiple parallel universes
   - **View Statistics**: See overall garden statistics
   - **Let Time Flow**: Advance time and watch evolution happen
   - **Save Garden**: Persist your garden (auto-saves on exit)

## Unique Game Mechanics

### Quantum Superposition
Your garden exists in multiple states at once. Each state has:
- Its own probability (likelihood of being "real")
- Unique plant configurations
- Independent growth patterns
- Different evolutionary paths

### Observer Effect
When you "collapse" a quantum state by observing it, you force reality to choose one outcome. All other quantum states cease to exist. This is irreversible and mirrors quantum mechanics!

### Reality Splitting
From a collapsed (single) state, you can create new superpositions, branching reality into multiple timelines. Each branch evolves independently.

### Temporal Evolution
The garden tracks real-world time. When you return after hours or days, your garden will have evolved based on how much time passed. Plants spread, mutate, and grow according to quantum probability.

### Plant Mutations
Plants evolve and mutate based on:
- Quantum probability of their state
- Age of the garden
- Random quantum fluctuations

Plant evolution chain examples:
- 🌱 → 🌿 → 🌳 (seed → sprout → tree)
- 🌾 → 🌻 → 🌺 (grain → sunflower → hibiscus)
- 🍀 → ☘️ (lucky clover spreads)

## Philosophy

Quantum Garden is a meditation on:
- **Choice and consequence** - Every observation collapses infinite possibilities
- **Parallel realities** - What could have been vs. what is
- **Impermanence** - States evolve and change over time
- **The observer's role** - Your attention shapes reality

## Save System

Your garden automatically saves to `quantum_garden_save.json`. The game calculates how much real-world time has passed since your last session and evolves the garden accordingly.

## What Makes This Unique?

1. **Quantum mechanics as core gameplay** - Not just a theme, but actual game mechanics
2. **Multiple simultaneous realities** - See different versions of your choices
3. **Real-time persistent evolution** - Your garden grows in real-time, even when you're not playing
4. **Philosophical meditation** - About observation, choice, and reality
5. **Procedural ASCII art** - Each quantum state generates unique patterns
6. **No combat, no scoring** - Pure creative expression and contemplation
7. **Infinite replayability** - Quantum randomness ensures uniqueness

## Example Gameplay

```
Turn 1: Start with a seed in 3 quantum states
Turn 2: Plant more seeds at different locations
Turn 3: Let time flow - garden evolves differently in each state
Turn 4: View all states - see parallel evolution
Turn 5: Collapse to favorite state - other realities vanish
Turn 6: Split reality again - create new branches
Turn 7: Wait real hours/days - return to evolved garden
```

## Technical Details

- Written in Python 3 with zero external dependencies
- Uses only standard library (json, os, random, time, datetime, typing)
- Persistent state using JSON serialization
- Real-time calculation based on system time
- Cross-platform (Windows, Mac, Linux)
